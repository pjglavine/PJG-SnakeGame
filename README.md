# PJG-SnakeGame
A simple 2D Snake game built using C++ and SDL. This is my capstone project for the C++ Nanodegree program with Udacity.

[Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). The code for this repo was inspired by [this](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/212296/snake-game-in-c-with-sdl) excellent StackOverflow post and set of responses.

The goal in the game is to grow your snake as big as possible by eating the food (yellow blocks) and avoiding the poison (red blocks). While eating food grows the snake, eating poison will cause your snake and your score to shrink. If the snake size is small (only one blue block) and it eats poison it will die and it's game over. The walls are also deadly to the snake so avoid running into those! The snake is controlled using the arrow keys with the ENTER key allowing the player to pause and unpause games in progress.

The game utilizes several SDL libraries to render the game, receive controller input and output audio such as music and in-game event sounds. All game sounds and music were created by me using BeepBox https://beepbox.co.

## Dependencies for Running Locally
* cmake >= 3.7

* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* SDL2 >= 2.0
  * All installation instructions can be found [here](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation)
  * Note that for Linux, an `apt` or `apt-get` installation is preferred to building from source.
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory in the top level directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./SnakeGame`.

## C++ Capstone Project
## README (All Rubric Points REQUIRED)
| Criteria | Meets Specifications | Place Implemented|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| A README with instructions is included with the project | A README with instructions is included with the project. The README is included with the project and has instructions for building/running the project. If any additional libraries are needed to run the project, these are indicated with cross-platform installation instructions. | Here |
| The README indicates which project is chosen. | The README describes the project you have built. The README also indicates the file and class structure, along with the expected behavior or output of the program. | Here |
| The README includes information about each rubric point addressed. | The README indicates which rubric points are addressed. The README also indicates where in the code (i.e. files and line numbers) that the rubric points are addressed. | Here |

## Compiling and Testing (All Rubric Points REQUIRED)
| Criteria | Meets Specifications | Place Implemented |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|The submission must compile and run.| The project code must compile and run without errors. We strongly recommend using cmake and make, as provided in the starter repos. If you choose another build system, the code must compile on any reviewer platform. |  |

## Loops, Functions, I/O
| Criteria | Meets Specifications | Place Implemented|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| The project demonstrates an understanding of C++ functions and control structures. | A variety of control structures are used in the project. The project code is clearly organized into functions.| The control scheme for the menu system in main() |
| The project reads data from a file and process the data, or the program writes data to a file. | The project reads data from an external file or writes data to a file as part of the necessary operation of the program. | audio.h reads audio files from an assets folder. |
| The project accepts user input and processes the input. | The project accepts input from a user as part of the necessary operation of the program. | controller.cpp menu.cpp both show how input is received from users to control aspects of the application. |

## Object Oriented Programming
| Criteria | Meets Specifications | Place Implemented|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| The project uses Object Oriented Programming techniques. | The project code is organized into classes with class attributes to hold the data, and class methods to perform tasks. | Classes used throughout, see menu.cpp and sound.cpp |
| Classes use appropriate access specifiers for class members. | All class data members are explicitly specified as public, protected, or private. | menu.cpp shows class with added accessors. All class functions and variables explicitly specified as public, protected, or private.
| Class constructors utilize member initialization lists. | All class members that are set to argument values are initialized through member initialization lists. | |
| Class constructors utilize member initialization lists. | All class members that are set to argument values are initialized through member initialization lists. | |
| Classes abstract implementation details from their interfaces. | All class member functions document their effects, either through function names, comments, or formal documentation. Member functions do not change program state in undocumented ways. | |
| Classes encapsulate behavior. | Appropriate data and functions are grouped into classes. Member data that is subject to an invariant is hidden from the user. State is accessed via member functions. | |
| Classes follow an appropriate inheritance hierarchy. | Inheritance hierarchies are logical. Composition is used instead of inheritance when appropriate. Abstract classes are composed of pure virtual functions. Override functions are specified. | |
| Overloaded functions allow the same function to operate on different parameters. | One function is overloaded with different signatures for the same function name. | |
| Derived class functions override virtual base class functions. | One member function in an inherited class overrides a virtual base class member function. | |
| Templates generalize functions in the project. | One function is declared with a template that allows it to accept a generic parameter. | |

## Memory Management
| Criteria | Meets Specifications | Place Implemented|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| The project makes use of references in function declarations. | At least two variables are defined as references, or two functions use pass-by-reference in the project code. | |
| The project uses destructors appropriately. | At least one class that uses unmanaged dynamically allocated memory, along with any class that otherwise needs to modify state upon the termination of an object, uses a destructor. | |
| The project uses scope / Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) where appropriate. | The project follows the Resource Acquisition Is Initialization pattern where appropriate, by allocating objects at compile-time, initializing objects when they are declared, and utilizing scope to ensure their automatic destruction. | |
| The project follows the Rule of 5. | For all classes, if any one of the copy constructor, copy assignment operator, move constructor, move assignment operator, and destructor are defined, then all of these functions are defined. | |
| The project uses move semantics to move data, instead of copying it, where possible. | For classes with move constructors, the project returns objects of that class by value, and relies on the move constructor, instead of copying the object. | |
| The project uses smart pointers instead of raw pointers. | The project uses at least one smart pointer: unique_ptr, shared_ptr, or weak_ptr. The project does not use raw pointers. | |

## Concurrency
| Criteria | Meets Specifications | Place Implemented|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| The project uses multithreading. | The project uses multiple threads in the execution. | |
| A promise and future is used in the project. | A promise and future is used to pass data from a worker thread to a parent thread in the project code. | |
| A mutex or lock is used in the project. | A mutex or lock (e.g. std::lock_guard or `std::unique_lock) is used to protect data that is shared across multiple threads in the project code. | |
| A condition variable is used in the project. | A std::condition_variable is used in the project code to synchronize thread execution. | |
